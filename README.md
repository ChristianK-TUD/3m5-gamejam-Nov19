## Summary
In the 6th gamejam of 3m5, 5 groups of 3-5 people came together to develop games around the topics shown below.
In an early meeting on Saturday, all participants had to vote democratically for 1 of 3 groups, containing 15 random german words each.
There was no regulation, how many of these topics must be included in the final product.

Our team was developing a 3D casual game, where the player must flee from a monastery.
